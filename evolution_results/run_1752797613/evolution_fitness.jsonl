If it's related to a specific framework or library, please provide more context.\n\nTo give a more precise answer, please provide more details about the error message, the code you're using, and any relevant configurations or setups you've done with Entity Framework Core and LINQ.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might use Entity Framework Core with LINQ to query data:\n\n```csharp\nusing (var dbContext = new YourDbContext())\n{\n    var results = dbContext.YourEntity\n        .Where(e => e.YourProperty == someValue)\n        .ToList();\n}\n```\n\nMake sure your `YourDbContext` is set up correctly, and `YourEntity` exists in your database.\n\nIf you're facing a specific error or exception, it would be helpful to see the exact message you're getting."}
